# Main Version

## Statement

How many ways are there to draw four dots on a piece of paper such that whichever two dots you choose, the distance between these two points is one of only two possible values?

Here is one correct example:

## Correct Answer

6

## Hint

Try drawing an equilateral triangle. That will give you three points that are all the same distance from each other. Where could you put the fourth point?

## Explanation

If we call the two distances "short" and "long", then any such drawing of points must have a triangle with one long and two short edges (it's not quite obvious, but if you think about it a bit you can eliminate all other possibilities). Now where does the last point go? To each of the other 3 points, it's connected either via a long or a short edge, giving 8 possibilities. Try out each of them, you will notice that 2 of them do not work out, leaving 6 solutions.

Short edges are represented by **blue** while long edges are represented by **green**. One of these solutions can be extended to 5 points that only use two distances, see bottom right picture.

# Extension 1

## Statement

In how many different ways can you draw 4 points in the plane whose pairwise distances are √2, √2, 2, √10, √10 and 4?

## Hint

Try to figure out what kind of triangles you can make that use 3 of the 6 distances. If you have squared paper, it helps that it is possible to put all the vertices on the grid.

## Correct Answer

2

## Explanation

This set of distances is quite special! For most sets of pairwise distances, there is only one solution, but here there are two.
