## Statement

The pattern 123451234512345... is continued to form a 2000 digit number.

What is the sum of all 2000 digits?

## Correct Answer

6000

## Hint

How many times does the pattern 12345 appear in the 2000 digit number?

## Explanation

The five numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 add up to 15. If the pattern is continued for 2000 digits there will be 2000 ∕ 5 = 400 sets of these five numbers. 400×15 = 6000.

# Extension 1

## Statement

The pattern 123456712345671234567... is continued to form a 2100 digit number.

What is the sum of all 2100 digits?

## Hint

What do the numbers 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 add up to?

## Correct Answer

8400

## Explanation

The seven numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 add up to 28. If the pattern is continued for 2100 digits there will be 2100 ∕ 7 = 300 sets of these seven numbers. 300×28 = 8400.

# Extension 2 

## Statement

The pattern 1234...n,1234,...n,1234…,n is carried on for 120000 digits. If the sum of these digits is 960000, what is n equal to? 

## Hint

Try dividing 960000 by 120000. What does this answer represent?

## Correct Answer

15

## Explanation

960000 is the sum of all the digits. There are 120000 digits, so dividing 960000 by 120000 gives us the average of the digits. This is 8, so we are looking for a sequence of numbers 1, 2, 3, … with an average of 8. This must be 1, 2, 3, …, 15.

# Additional information

## About

There is a formula for adding the numbers 1, 2, 3, …, n together. It is ½×n×(n + 1). For example 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 = 28 can be found by  ½×7×8  = 28. 

The sequence of numbers that this formula gives are called triangular numbers. The first ten are 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, and 55.
