  "This is a two player game. Player 1 secretly chooses four cards and puts them in a row face down. Player 2 has seven attempts to guess the suits (clubs, diamonds, hearts, spades) of these cards, in order. Player 2 guesses by laying four cards in a row face up. Player 1 looks at the suits, and tells them how many suits they guessed in the correct position (x), and how many other suits they have guessed correctly but in the wrong position (o). Player 2 uses this information to make a better guess next time.": "Huu ni mchezo wa wachezaji wawili. Mchezaji 1 huchagua kadi nne kwa siri na kuziweka kwenye safu kifudifudi. Mchezaji 2 ana majaribio saba ya kukisia suti (vilabu, almasi, mioyo, jembe) za kadi hizi, kwa mpangilio. Mchezaji 2 anakisia kwa kuwekea kadi nne mfululizo uso juu. Mchezaji 1 anaangalia suti, na kuwaambia ni suti ngapi walizokisia katika nafasi sahihi (x), na ni suti ngapi zingine ambazo wamekisia kwa usahihi lakini katika nafasi isiyo sahihi (o). Mchezaji 2 hutumia maelezo haya kufanya ubashiri bora wakati ujao.",

  "Player 2 has three correct suits (Heart, Spade and Spade) and two in the correct position - 1) and 4) so Player 1 would say \"you have two in the correct position and one in the wrong position\", but doesn't say which ones - an easy way to record this would be xxo. Then player 2 would guess again. They might think that it was the last two cards that were perfectly correct, so keep these and guess a different first two. Recording the results on pen and paper will be necessary and would look like this:": "Player 2 has three correct suits (Heart, Spade and Spade) and two in the correct position - 1) and 4) so Player 1 would say \"you have two in the correct position and one in the wrong position\", but doesn't say which ones - an easy way to record this would be xxo.

  "For the guesser: Your first guess will be at random but after that you should be using logic to work out what the solution might be. One good strategy for beginners is just change one card at a time, but as you play more you may find a better optimal strategy.": "For the guesser: Your first guess will be at random but after that you should be using logic to work out what the solution might be.
